				John McCarthy, (born September 4, 1927, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 24, 2011, Stanford, California), American mathematician and computer scientist who was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence (AI); his main research in the field involved the formalization of commonsense knowledge.

				McCarthy received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics (1948) from the California Institute of Technology and a doctorate in mathematics (1951) from Princeton University, where he briefly taught. He also held professorships at Dartmouth College (1955–58); the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1958–62), where he worked on the earliest time-sharing systems; and Stanford University (1953–55 and 1962–2000), where he founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), one of the leading centres for research in the field.
